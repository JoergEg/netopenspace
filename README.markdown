.NET Open Space
======================================================================

Before you can build the project with the `build.cmd` script you have to add Rake to your working directory. To do so, execute the following commands on a Git prompt:

<pre>
git submodule init
git submodule update
</pre>

Rake and accompanying tasks that are included as a [Git submodule](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-submodule.html) can be found [here](http://github.com/agross/rake-me).
